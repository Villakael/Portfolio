            <p>
              My intrest in technology started while I was in highschool, and since then I've been trying to soak in as much information as possible, Whether it is Hardware, Software, or Networking to transition into CyberSecurity
              <br><br>Since I was a child, I've always been passionate about
              all things technology, whether it's hardware, software, or user
              experience. I've even built my own computer and recreated popular
              board games using Python and Pygame. <br><br>This website
              itself has been a great opportunity for me to learn more about
              front-end design, and my time as a software developer for
              McMaster's battery workforce has shown me a lot about back-end and
              hardware integration. <br><br>I've also worked in tech sales
              for two years, which has taught me a great deal about working in
              teams and effective communication with coworkers and customers.
              <br><br>Looking for internships during
              the upcoming 2025 summer and am on the looking out for any
              opportunities/volunteering!
